## Moving Forwared  

**How To Divide Work: **
1. Create Nicely formatted Graphs 
2. Create graphs that show different values based on inputs 
3. Get correct inputs from Shiny App 
4. Look for interesting points/Start the write-up 

**Steps**
0. Format Data to be a proportion of deaths instead of total deaths (new csv) 
1. Make a nice bar chart of disease & deaths. 
2. Shiny app shows bar chart based on country selection 
3. Country selection in the format of autofill text input 
4. Add year selection slider or multiselect (both?) 
5. Add text explanation 
	- You can use these selectors to examine...
	- Interesting Fact! Compare x and y and notice how... 
6. Fun formatting of Shiny App? 

**Optional**: 
5. Add tab to investigate Cause -> by year or country...

## Milestone 3: 
Formats: Shiny App (Interactive visualization that could be hosted on a public website) 

Visualizations: 
- Do visualizations support the most important queries? 
- is the information density sufficiently rich so audience can infer? 
- Do visualizations flow naturally from one to the next? 
	- overview -> highlighted details 

Text: 
- choherently ties together visalizations 
- identifies key messages (section headers/interfce tabs) 
- shape story around data 
- Discuss knowledge gaps 
- connect findings to something readers will relate to 

Discussion: 
- improvments to be made
