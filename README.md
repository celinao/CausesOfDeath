## Milestone 3: 
Two Potential Formats: 
- Format 1: Scientific Journal Format (i.e. Report with static visualizations) 
- Format 2: Shiny App (Interactive visualization that could be hosted on a public website) 

Visualizations: 
- Do visualizations support the most important queries? 
- is the information density sufficiently rich so audience can infer? 
- Do visualizations flow naturally from one to the next? 
	- overview -> highlighted details 

Text: 
- choherently ties together visalizations 
- identifies key messages (section headers/interfce tabs) 
- shape story around data 
- Discuss knowledge gaps 
- connect findings to something readers will relate to 

Discussion: 
- improvments to be made
